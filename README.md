## ⚙️ Model Setup (Important)

This project uses the YOLOv8 model for detection.

Due to GitHub file size limits, the model file is not included in this repository.

### Download the model:
Download `yolov8n.pt` from the official Ultralytics link:  
https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8n.pt

### After downloading:
Place the `yolov8n.pt` file inside the main project folder (same location as `app.py`).

Then run the project normally.

The application will automatically load the model from that location.
